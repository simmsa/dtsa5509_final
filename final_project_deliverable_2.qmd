# Deliverable 1
A Jupyter notebook showing a supervised learning problem description, EDA procedure, analysis (model building and training), result, and discussion/conclusion.

Suppose your work becomes so large that it doesnâ€™t fit into one notebook (or you think it will be less readable by having one large notebook). In that case, you can make several notebooks or scripts in a GitHub repository (as deliverable 3) and submit a report-style notebook or pdf instead.

If your project doesn't fit into Jupyter notebook format (E.g. you built an app that uses ML), write your approach as a report and submit it in a pdf form.
